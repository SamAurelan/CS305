# CS305

    Artemis Financial is a firm wanting to enable their clients to be able to choose from different financial plans
   depending on their unique needs.

    I had trouble identifying the false positives and generating the checksum using local host with with either Chrome or Firefox.

    If there was a way to use Eclipse on Apporto with this project instead of having to download it, that might have made it a little easier
    for me.
